# unconfUROS
The annual [conference on the use of R in official statistics](https://www.aanmelder.nl/uros2018) will take place on the premises of Statistics Netherlands September 12-14. We are excited to announce an unconference use of R in official statistics on the two days just before the uRos conference.

## Motivation
The idea behind the event (similar to http://unconf17.ropensci.org/ for R in general) to bring together useRs from the area of official statistics to work for two days on concrete projects where enhancements would benefit many institutes, organisation,... .


Similar to the idea of the [awesome official statistics software](http://www.awesomeofficialstatistics.org) list, this should complement an abstract top-down approach such as the [common statistical production architecture](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/CSPA/CSPA+v1.5) with fast bottom-up solutions.

## Presentation

The results of unconfUROS will be presented during the ensuing uRos2018 conference.

   - [unconfUROS result](https://github.com/uRos2018/nlgeocoder)

## Other ideas

 - [Machine learning techniques for imputation (boosting, deep learning, ....)](doc/MLimputation.md)
 - Sampling package that covers the need of NSIs
 - A shiny app for statistical disclosure control of tabular data (using [sdcTable](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sdcTable))


## We are fully booked!
